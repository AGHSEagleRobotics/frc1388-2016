FRC Style Guide Take 2
Would be in Wiki but that does not work properly with indents

By Isaiah and Lucian

Indent: Every time you go into a level you indent an additional time
{lorem ipsum
1	dolor sit
1	2	amet}

Camelcase -- Classes Start With Upper, objects lower

Constants -- All Uppercase and use underscores

Do NOT allow unbracketed "if" statements

No code following an open bracket 
 NO: { sample text}
YES: {
	sample text}
DO NOT EDIT AUTOGENERATED CODE
HE (OR SHE) WHO COMMITS SUCH A HEINOUS CRIME SHALL FACE THE WRATH OF (actually I don't know what you will face the wrath of but... 
I hear it is pretty bad.) SO DON'T DO IT (Unless instructed to by Joey, Tommy, or a qualified Mentor)
	
The word "Cool" is henceforth banned forever under penalty of death
